OBJECTIVES:
- Get familiar with parsing JSON format
- Learn how to separate responsibilities of your program into several sub-methods

SPECS:
If you watch French TV, you may have stumbled upon Des chiffres et des lettres. One of the many equivalent programs in English is Countdown!

The goal of this challenge is to write a simplified version of this game from the terminal where:

  - You are given a random set of letters.
  - You have to enter the longest english word you can find using only letters in the grid.
  - After typing your answer, you get your score combined with the time you took, and eventually an error message if you failed.
